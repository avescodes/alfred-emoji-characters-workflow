# Search Emoji characters using Alfred 2

It's like
[alfred-emoji-workflow](https://github.com/carlosgaldino/alfred-emoji-workflow),
but it returns characters!

**Usage**: `:[query]`

After you hit `<enter>` the Emoji character (think :beer:, not `:beer:`) will be copied to
your pastebuffer and simultaneous pasted into the active window.
